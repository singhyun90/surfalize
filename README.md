surfalize is a python package for analyzing microscope topography measurement data in terms of surface
roughness and other topographic parameters. It is intended primarily for microtextured surfaces and is supposed to 
replace software packages such as MountainsMap, MultiFileAnalyzer and Gwyddion for the most common tasks.

## Disclaimer
The authors make no guarantees for the correctness of any results obtained using this package. The package is an early work in progress
and may introduce changes to both implementation details and public API at any point in time. Any results should be validated against established 
software to verify their correctness, especially when they are intended to be used for scientific publications. 

Some parts of the package are more mature and some are in early development stage. Currently, Gaussian filtering and Profile parameters might 
suffer from some implementation errors and might not be entirely compliant with ISO standards. Care should be taken when relying on these
specific functionalities.

## How to install

To install the latest release of surfalize, run the following command: 
```commandline
pip install surfalize
```
If you want to build from source, clone this git repository and run the following command in the root folder
of the cloned repository.
```commandline
pip install .
```
However, you will need to have both `Cython` and a C-Compiler installed (MSVC on Windows, 
gcc on Linux, MinGW is not supported currently). If you install in editable mode using
```
pip install -e .
```
be aware that a change of the pyx files does not reinvoke the Cython build process.

<sup>1</sup> Per default, Sdr calculation uses the algorithm proposed by ISO 25178 and also used by MountainsMap
By keyword argument, the Gwyddion algorithm can be used instead.\
<sup>2</sup> Gwyddion does not support Sdr calculation directly, but calculates surface area and projected
area. 

## Supported parameters of 1d-periodic surfaces

Additionally, this package supports the calculation of non-standard parameters for periodic textured surfaces with one-
dimensional periodic structures. The following parameters can be calculated:

| Parameter    | Description                                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Period       | Dominant spatial period of the 1d-surface texture            | 
| Depth        | Peak-to-valley depth of the 1d-texture profiles              | 
| Aspect ratio | Ratio of peak-to-valley depth to spatial period              |
| Homogeneity  | Homogeneity factor (0 < H < 1) calculated from Gini analysis |
| Orientation  | Clockwise angle of the dominant texture to the vertical axis |
